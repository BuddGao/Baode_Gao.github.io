### Research
I have learned cure rate model by subgroup analysis. I also have worked to linear mixed model and contributed an article to a known ACM conference. Recently, I studied about graph neural network by self, implemented some classical models and had some new ideas. I'm interested and enthusiastic to do further study on statistics and machine learning. I am looking for opportunities for summer research in 2022. [Here](documents/CV_Baode GAO.pdf) is my CV.

### About
I got my bachelor's degree in applied mathematics from [XJTLU](https://www.xjtlu.edu.cn/en/) in 2020. I am currently a first year MS student in Biostatistics, [Columbia University](https://www.columbia.edu/). My goal is to become a professor in Biostatistics.
